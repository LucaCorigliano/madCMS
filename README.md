## madCMS
A silly markdown based CMS


### Why?
I had this weird vision where my whole personal website was based on static Markdown pages.

### How to use
- Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/LucaCorigliano/madCMS`
- Customize your template in `template.handlebars`
- Put your static pages in `public`
- Deploy as you prefer (you have to run `npm run dist`, I'm lazy and I din't use webpack)
