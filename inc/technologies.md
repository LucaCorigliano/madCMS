### Technologies used

I'm kinda lazy so I will just include my `package.json` automatically under here!

In all seriousness, huge thanks to all the open source communities, especially for the software I'm currently using. Missing from the list are `nginx` powering the web server and `Debian` powering my scrappy VPS.

Write code, share code, drink coffee.
